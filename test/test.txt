[Unit 0, 0.1 Home sweet home, Exercise 3 and 4]
[presenter – male, in his 30s; Jorge – 17 years old; Ellie – 17 years old; Michael – 17 years old; Michael has a standard British accent; Ellie has a standard American English accent; Jorge – slight Mexican accent]
Presenter:	Welcome to ‘Home Sweet Home’. Today we’re interviewing people who have unusual homes.  Jorge, can you tell us where you live? 
Jorge:	I live in a hotel.  In fact I’ve lived in this hotel since I was born. My parents run the hotel – that’s their job.  
Presenter:	Have you ever lived in a house or an apartment?
Jorge:	No, I haven’t.  But I love living in a hotel.  You meet a lot of interesting people, and the neighbors change all the time! Sometimes it’s hard because I become friends with people who stay for a while and then they leave. It’s hard after they’ve left.  But there are lots of good things about living in a hotel – I can use the swimming pool every day, and I never have to make my bed.  It’s great.
Presenter:	Thanks Jorge.   Our next guest is Ellie. Where do you live Ellie?
Ellie:	I’m living on a boat at the moment.  
Presenter:	Have you ever lived in a house or an apartment?
Ellie:	Oh yes, I live in a house with my parents half the year, and half the year we live on the boat. It’s too cold in winter. I’ve been on the boat for two months now.
Presenter:	Do you move around much?
Ellie:	Not very much, but it’s nice to know that we can move if we want to. 
Presenter:	Thank you Ellie. Our third and final guest for today is Michael.  Where do you live Michael?
Michael:	I live in a school.  My father is a head master of a boarding school, so we live there.
Presenter:	What’s it like living in a school?
Michael:	It’s OK. I enjoy living near my friends
Presenter:	Have you ever been late for class?
Michael:	Ha ha. No, I’m always on time.

[Unit 0, 0.2 National dishes, Exercise 4]
[adult speaker, male West coast American accent]
Did you recognize the national dishes and where they come from? 
The first one is a simple dish: you cook some lamb, a lot of potatoes and a few onions together. Some people add carrots and other vegetables, but experts say that the real stew doesn’t have any other vegetables. This simple but delicious stew is the national dish of Ireland.

In the next English-speaking country, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding is a popular dish for Sunday lunchtime but most people say that fish and chips is the national dish. Unfortunately, it’s been so popular that there isn’t much cod left in the sea! Of course, this is the national dish of England.

Moving on, it’s hard to choose one national dish for this huge country because there are so many regional dishes. But few people can resist the most popular dish in this country:  a big hamburger with lots of fries and ketchup. Yes, you’ve guessed – we’re talking about the US.

Finally, in our last country there aren’t any ‘national dishes’, but there are a few favorites: meat pies, roast lamb and vegetables, barbequed steak and sausages. Where will you find all that meat? In Australia, of course.

[Unit 0, 0.3 Flashmob, Exercise 5]
[two teenage speakers: male and female; Simon has a standard American English accent, Ruth has a standard British accent]
[Simon is very enthusiastic. Ruth is hesitant and unsure]
Ruth:	Hi Simon. How are you doing?
Simon:	Really well! I’ve just finished my exams.
Ruth:	Oh great. Lucky you. I haven’t finished yet - three more to go. 
Simon:	Oh well, good luck. Listen, have you ever seen a flashmob?
Ruth:	Yes, I saw one on YouTube yesterday. It was fantastic. But I haven’t seen one in real life.
Simon:	Me neither, but I’ve watched a few online. Yesterday, I watched a surprise flashmob for a girl’s eighteenth birthday. 
Ruth:	Oh, OKright!
Simon:	So I want to organize one for my sister’s birthday. Will you help me? You have to learn a dance.
Ruth:	[Really hesitant] Dance? Are you sure? Have you asked anybody else yet?
Simon:	Yes, I’ve already asked lots of people. I spoke to Sally five minutes ago and she said yes. 

Ruth:	But she’s a good dancer and I’m not!
Simon:	Don’t worry, we have plenty of time. I haven’t chosen the music yet!

[Unit 0, 0.4 Money, money, money, Exercise 4]
[narrator; two speakers,teenagers aged 16 -17,, male and female; East coast American accent]
Narrator:	TEEN ATTITUDES ABOUT MONEY
We ask brother and sister Tom and Zoey about their attitudes about money and shopping. 

Narrator: 	Zoey 
Zoey:		I think I’m very good with money. I don’t have much money though because I’m still in school, but I’m more careful than my brother. For example, he spends his birthday money as soon as he gets it. Also he’s older than me and has a weekend job, so he’s richer than I am. To be honest, I think he’s stupid with his money. The most expensive thing I’ve ever bought is a leather jacket, and that was second hand, so it wasn’t as expensive as a new one. I don’t go out much – Tom says I’m not sociable enough, but I just like staying at home.



Narrator: 	Tom
Tom: 	I’m more generous than Zoey. In fact, I’m probably too generous! If I have money, I spend it. I’m richer than Zoey because I work over the weekend but she’s more careful than me so she always has money and I never have any. Actually, I think Zoey’s the meanest stingiest person I know! My clothes are more expensive than Zoey’s but I buy expensive clothes because people who make cheap clothes have the worst working conditions in the world. I spend a lot of money on going out. Zoey isn’t as popular as I am so she stays at home more!

Emma:	OK, but I can’t go Friday evening. I’m babysitting. 
Luke:	OK, what about Saturday? I’m going to the dentist in the morning, but I’m free after that. 
Emma:	I can’t go Saturday. I’m going to a wedding.
Luke:	A wedding? 
Emma:	Yes, my cousin’s getting married. I’m a bridesmaid. What about Sunday? I’m not doing anything on Sunday.
Luke:	Um, I’m playing football in the afternoon. But I’m free in the evening. It starts at 7:30.

Emma:	[still half asleep] Yeah – what time?
Luke:	It starts at 7:30 but I’m going to get there early. We want good seats, don’t we?
Emma:	Yeah, we do.
Luke:	I’m going to get a lift ride with my mom. Do you want us to pick you up?
Emma:	Please.

[Unit 0, 0.6 My technology, Exercise 4]
[two adult speakers – male and female: presenter – male; standard American English]
Presenter:	Good morning and welcome to Connected, our weekly technology program. Today we have Susan Redwood in the studio. Susan’s a psychologist and she studies the effect of technology on the brain. Susan, we read a lot of negative stuff about technology. What do you think?
SR:	Technology is wonderful but we must use it carefully. If technology rules your life, you won’t be a happy healthy person. For example, if you spend a lot of time playing video games and you don’t get any exercise, you won’t be healthy. But I don’t know many people like that. Most young people I know play video games but they also play sports. 
Presenter:	What about people who are addicted to video games?
SR:	Some people have addictive personalities and they don’t know when to stop. In these cases their studies will suffer. But it’s a very small percentage of people who are addicted to video games. Most students play video games when they’ve finished their homework, and they continue to get good grades at school. 
Presenter:	Do you think social networking makes people antisocial?
SR:	I get really annoyed when people say that social networking replaces real friends. It’s just not true. In fact, social networking is all about communicating, and connecting with other people. It helps shy people and it’s a very good thing.
Presenter:	But if you use social networking, will you lose your privacy?
SR:	If you don’t use social networking carefully you’ll lose your privacy. It’s very simple, if you want to keep something secret, don’t write about it online. 
Presenter:	Some people say you shouldn’t use technology for a few hours before bedtime.
SR:	That’s true. If you use the Internet or play video games in bed, you won’t sleep very well because your brain will be stimulated. My advice is to put technology away a couple of hours before bedtime and read a book in bed.

[Unit 0, 0.6 My technology, Exercise 7 and 8]
[two teenagers, male and female, about 18 years old; Jake standard American English accent, Maria standard British accent]
Maria:	Do you feel like doing a questionnaire about technology, Jake?
Jake:		Yeah, why not. 
Maria:	OK. Question 1 .... What would you buy if you had 500 dollars to spend on technology?
Jake:	Er, I love listening to music really loudly. So if I had 500 dollars to spend, I’d buy new speakers. 
Maria:	I don’t suppose your parents would be very happy about that.  If I had 500 dollars, I definitely wouldn’t buy speakers – I’d buy a laptop so I wouldn’t have to borrow my mom’s. Could you live without your laptop?
Jake:	Erm, yes. If I had to live without one of my devices, I’d probably give up my laptop. I could do everything on my phone.
Maria:	Ah, it’s OK for you – I only have one device, my phone. So if I had to give up my phone, I wouldn’t be able to go online or text or anything.
Jake:	Oh no!  So what would you do if you were with a friend and she texted to someone else the whole time?
Maria:	If there were only two of us, I’d be really annoyed. I think it’s rude. 
Jake:	Really? I wouldn’t care if my friend texted someone else the whole time. I’d do the same.
Maria:	Well, please don’t do it when you’re with me.  Anyway, next question… if you had a blog, what would you blog about? 
Jake:	If I had a blog, I’d blog about food. What about you?
Maria:	I don’t have time to blog, but if I had time, I’d blog about music. 
Jake:	Oh yes, you’d be good at that. And the last question, if you could time travel, what time would you travel to?
Maria:	I think I’d go to 1970 if I could. I really like the music of that time.
Jake:	Oh, if I could time travel, I’d go to the future, to the year 3000!
Maria:	The year 3000! There may not be a world then …..

[Unit 0, 0.7 Growing up, Exercise 6]
[adult speaker, West coast American accent]
THE STRICT TEACHER: 
She stands at the front of the class and you have to listen to her. When she asks a question, you're not allowed to call out the answer. You have to raise your hand in the air. You mustn’t talk in class and you have to do your homework on time –  no excuses. 

THE RELAXED TEACHER: 
The opposite of the strict teacher. You are allowed to call out answers and sometimes, you can call him by his first name. You have to do your homework but you don’t need to do it exactly on time. But there are rules. You can’t use your phone in class, and when you talk to your classmates, it has to be about the subject of the lessonclass.

[Unit 0, 0.8 Young entrepreneurs, Exercise 3]
[adult speaker, male; standard British accent]
What is an entrepreneur?
Entrepreneurs are people who can turn dreams into reality. They enjoy being in situations that challenge them. They are the kind of people that take risks and they don’t follow the crowd. They want to create things that inspire other people. At school they often have problems which that teach them important life skills. There are many successful entrepreneurs who start life with little money or education. There are plenty of colleges where you can learn business skills, but there is one essential quality that they can’t teach you in college: passion!

[NB – pronunciation. Chocolit – ‘ch’ like in English chocolate. Chocolatier – ‘ch’ like in English chocolate, but ending in a schwa and with the stress on ‘i’]
Louis’s Story
Louis  Barnett is a 23-year-old entrepreneur from England who has a passion for chocolate. When he was 11, he was having difficulties in school so his parents found a tutor who could teach him at home. One day he made a cake his family and friends enjoyed so much that they asked him to make more. He learned about different ways of making chocolate and at the age of 12 he set up a company he called ‘Chokolit’. The name is inspired by the problems he has had with spelling!
He is interested in environmental protection so he never uses ingredients that damage the environment. He also works with a co-operative in the Caribbean where they run all their machinery with solar power. By the age of 15 Louis had become a qualified ‘chocolatier’ and one of the youngest entrepreneurs in the world.

[4 speakers: two males and two females. Tim – about 19 years old; Jon – in his early 20s; Angie and Becky – 18 years old; standard American English]
Narrator:  	Angie
Angie:	My friend took this photo. In fact, she took about 50 photos before we got a good one. But I like it, and I think I look OK. I’m not smiling because I look better when I don’t smile. I wanted to change my profile photo because I’ve changed my hair. I’m blond now and I think it suits me! I’m wearing vintage sunglasses, my favourite silver ring and some bangles from India. I’m also wearing a scarf in my hair, but you can’t see it in this photo. 
Narrator:  	Tim
Tim:		I love this photo – it was a great party. That’s me in the middle and the others are my classmates. We’re wearing formal clothes because it’s the end of school party. The girls are wearing designer dresses. They look so glamorous. Even the teachers looked elegant! This is the first time I’ve worn a suit to a party – when we started dancing, I got really hot! So later I took off my jacket, vest and tie, and at the end of the party I couldn’t find them. My mom was furious. 

Narrator:  	Becky
Becky:	My dad took this photo of me on my third birthday. I uploaded it because my friends don’t believe I had fair blond hair when I was little. I don’t look like that any more – I was better-looking then! But I still have the same smile. I love the woollen wool hat I’m wearing - it matches my winter coat – I’ve always been fashionable! I still wear thick tights, but not pink ones, and my mittens aren’t attached to my coat now. I think I look really sweet, but my parents say I was a naughty child. Some things don’t change!

Narrator:  	Jon
Jon:		This is me in Sierra Nevada. It’s really sunny so I’m just wearing a sweatshirt and shorts. Of course I have warm clothes in my backpack because camping at night can be cold – in the evening I changed into pants and a fleece. The most important thing is the hiking boots – they have to fit perfectly. I love camping in the mountains, but it’s too cold to get undressed and put pajamas on at night. I usually sleep in my clothes.

The question I’m asking is “What is the ‘Festival Look’ this year?”. Ten thousand people are listening to music here and I believe the temperature is 90º. I know the Killers are playing later and I’m thinking about going to see them, but right now I’m speaking to people about what they’re wearing and why.

Jo:	So which bands do you want to see today?

[Radio program. Female presenter, in her thirties. Jenny and Fraser are both 17; standard American English, 
Presenter:	Welcome to That’s Life. Our topic for today is friendship, and we’re going to talk to two young people, and ask them what their friendships mean to them. So hello Jenny and Fraser. 
Jenny:	Hello.
Fraser:	Hi.
Presenter:	Jenny, let’s talk to you first. You’re sixteen.
Jenny:	Seventeen.
Presenter:	Oh sorry, seventeen. Jenny, how many friends do you have?
Jenny:	Well, if you mean close friends, about five or six. But I have 313 online friends.
Presenter:	Let’s talk about the online friends first, shall we. 313! That’s a lot of friends. How well do you know them?
Jenny:	Some of them I know pretty well, but I look at some of the names and think “Who are these people?!” 
Presenter:	Hahaha. It’s so easy to make new online friends, isn’t it? They ask to be your friend, and you accept. It’s not as easy to make real life friends, is it?
Jenny:	That’s right. Making friends online takes a few minutes. But a real friend is somebody you get to know over a long period of time. You meet, you spend time together, you get to know one another - it takes a long time to become close friends. 
Presenter:	That’s right. But some friendships don’t last forever. And when you don’t want to continue a friendship, you can simply unfriend them, can’t you?
Jenny:	I’m not sure I agree with that actually. I find it really hard to unfriend online friends. It seems really mean. I suppose that’s why I have over 300 online friends. In real life, if you fall outhave a fight with a friend, you stop seeing them. Or sometimes you decide that you no longer have much in common. You no longer like the same things or you’ve changed. Then you lose touch. You don’t have to make the decision – it just happens naturally. 
Presenter:	Yes, I see what you mean. Fraser, what do you think? How do you make the difference between close friends and online friends?


Fraser:	Well, all my close friends are also online friends. When we don’t see one another, we chat online. But I’d say my closest friends are the ones I socialize with. We have a lot in common - we follow the same football team, we listen to the same music, and we go hiking and camping on weekends. We get along really well together.
Presenter:	Do you think there’s any difference between friendship between girls, and friendship between boys?
Fraser:	Um, I don’t know really. I don’t go shopping with my friends and we don’t paint one another’s nails! But I think the important things are the same. I know I can rely on my friends in a crisis. A good friend is always there for you. 
Presenter:	Yes, I suppose that’s right. What about friendship between girls and boys. Are any of your close friends female, Fraser?
Fraser:	Um, yeah of course. There are three or four girls as well as boys in the group of friends I hang out with. 
Presenter:	What about you Jenny?
Jenny:	Yes, I get along well with boys. But I think it’s different - girls understand one another better. And you’re never sure if the boys really want to be friends, or if they want to date you.

Who do you look like? Are you good-looking like your mom, well-built like your dad, blond-haired like your brother or sister, or really, really tall like your great-great-grandfatherparent? Do people say you’re just like your father, or just like your mother, or that you take after your grandparent in every way? Or do people ask where you come from because you look so different from the rest of your family?

Your genes are responsible for your appearance and your health. Half your genes are from your mother, the other half from your father. You are not identical to your mother or your father, but you probably look a bit like both of them. Or you may resemble one of your ancestors, for example a great-great-grandparent. But even if you are like other members of your family, you are unique. Your genes are different from everyone else’s genes. The only people who have exactly the same genes are identical twins. 

Some of the features you inherit from your parents are hair, eye color, skin color and facial features like the size and shape of your nose. 

You probably have the same hair color as one of your parents, but this is not always true. Two dark-haired parents can have a blond or red-headed child. This happens when there was a blond or red-headed ancestor. It is common for red-headed children to have freckles, even if the parents don't have them.

The strongest, or dominant gene in eye color is brown. If both parents have brown eyes, their children probably have brown eyes too. It’s also common for two brown-eyed parents to have a blue-eyed child, but unusual for two blue-eyed parents to have a brown-eyed child. As well as eye color you can inherit poor eyesight from your parents. So if you’re near-sighted you’re probably not the only person in your family who wears glasses.

Tall parents usually have tall children and short parents usually have short children. But this isn’t always true – in fact, children are getting taller thanks to improved diets and healthier lifestyles. 

50% of men with bald fathers will lose their hair. But the gene for baldness can come from the mother’s family too – boys should look at their mother’s father. They may take after him.
There are many different skin colors: from black, dark brown, brown, light brown to white. Most families share the same skin color, but black parents can give birth to a lighter-skinned child if they have pale-skinned ancestors.

Usually, a black and a white parent have dark-skinned children because black is a dominant gene. But twin sisters Hayleigh and Lauren are exceptions. One twin is black, and the other is white. Hayleigh looks exactly like her black father and Lauren is the image of her white mother. This was only possible because their father had a white relative in his past. 

Finally, if you are left-handed, or if you have dimples in your cheeks or chin, you can thank your genes.

The photos both show people in clothing  stores. In the first photo a woman is waiting for someone to choose a shirt. I think he’s her boyfriend or her husband. She looks bored. In the second photo I can see a boy. He’s waiting for some people. It’s hard to say but perhaps maybe they’re his sisters or friends. Both photos show people waiting and they look very bored. The main difference between the photos is that the woman looks more comfortable than the boy. He has to sit on the floor!

Welcome to Sports on Saturday. It’s quiz time! Let’s start with the answers to last week’s Sports Quiz. There were six questions …

OK, number 1 – we asked you which is the biggest: a football field, a golf course or an athletics track? The answer is of course (dramatic pause) b – a golf course.

Number 2! Where will you not see a man with a beard?  The correct answer is C, in a boxing ring. Why? Because it’s difficult to see injuries on the face if the boxer has a beard. 

Number 3 - in which sports do you hit a ball with a racket on a court? The correct answer is A, squash and tennis. For cricket and table tennisping-pong, you play with a bat. For golf you use clubs and in hockey, you play with a stick. 

Number 4 - Which piece of equipment is made of metal, rubber and sometimes wood? The answer is A, a golf club.  A table tennisping-pong bat and a hockey stick are made of wood and rubber. No metal. 

Number 5 – Where is the highest ski resort in the world? If you’re good at geography you’ll know the answer – it’s A Bolivia. Chacaltaya resort is about 5,290 meters high. The highest ski resort in Canada is Sunshine Village at 2,159  meters and Val Thorens in France is the highest ski resort in Europe at 2,300 meters.

And finally, number 6 – What can you find on the roof of the famous Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai? The correct answer is B – a tennis court. You can play a game of tennis and admire the view at the same time!

Well, that’s it. How did you do? Did you get a Gold, Silver or Bronze?

And now it’s time for this week’s quiz – the topic is …

I’m not into competitive sports. I’ll never break a world record, and I’m sure I’ll never win a prize for sports. In fact, I usually come in last in races and if I’m on a team, we always lose the match. I don’t understand people who need to come in first. I've even seen men cry when the opposing team scores a goal! I like being healthy and keeping fitstaying in shape. But I don’t need to beat my opponent – I just need to enjoy the game.

Speaker 1: 	The athlete I look up to most is Federer. He’s always been passionate about tennis, but he’s also a caring and generous human being. He’s given a lot of time and money to charities, especially children’s charities. He’s a real inspiration. In fact he has his own charity in South Africa for poor children. His charity pays for them to go to school and have two meals a day and encourages them to take up sports.

Speaker 2: 	Jessica Ennis inspires me. She’s a great athlete, but she’s also a normal, lovely person who is realistic about life. What I like most about her is that she’s an Olympic champion, but she’s also very modest. She says there are things she dislikes about herself when she looks in the mirror, and everybody can relate to that. I think she’s a much better example for young girls than skinny fashion models. She’s a healthy role model and a lot of girls follow her example and take up sports as a hobby or professionally.

Speaker 3: 	I think Robert Kubica’s story is inspiring. He was the first Polish racing driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix, but then he had a terrible accident and he nearly lost his arm. In spite of his serious injuries, he has stayed positive and returned to racing. He inspires young people because he is so courageous and determined.

 [female teen - 17, enthusiastic about water sports, West coast American accent]
Hi! My name’s Jackie Smith. I’m here today to tell you about how I became the international under-eighteen windsurfing champion at the age of sixteen! It’s something I’m really proud of. I think I’ve been successful because of two people really. My mom and my cousin Rachel have been my role models.
I first went windsurfing with my mom. We lived near the sea, and we spent every summer on the beach. My mom had entered windsurfing competitions when she was a teenager. She didn’t win anything but she really enjoyed it. She started to teach me windsurfing as soon as I could swim. I was only about seven years old. My cousin Rachel was there too. She and her family lived near us. My mom gave us classelessons together. Rachel is two years older than me and I’ve always looked up to her. I still do. Rachel was good at everything. She was a really good example for me – I wanted to be sporty like her. 

I did a lot of different water sports because I grew up near the sea and it was natural. At first, windsurfing wasn’t my favorite thing. I liked other water sports, like swimming and sailing. I used to go sailing with Rachel and then we joined a children’s sailing club. We spent all our weekends there, even in winter.
We did lots of sailing and then we got into rowing. I wasn’t sure about rowing at first but my mom thought it was a good idea. Now I’m glad I did it because it made my arms strong, and that helped my windsurfing.

Windsurfing became my number one sport thanks to Rachel. She entered a windsurfing competition when she was fifteen – I always wanted to do the same as her so I entered the competition too. She came in second and I came in fifth! But I really enjoyed myself, and that was the moment when I decided that windsurfing was my sport.

My mom and Rachel are still important role models for me. I think I take after my mom – I hope I have some of the same qualities anyway. And Rachel is like a big sister to me.

SHE WAS BORN THIS WAY
A positive attitude and a good sense of humor
Katy Sullivan is an actor, an athlete, a motivational speaker and a person who refuses to accept the words ‘no’ or ‘I can’t’. 
She was born without the lower half of her legs and has worn prosthetic legs all her life. She grew up in Alabama, US and had an active childhood. It was a normal childhood and she kept up with her siblings at the gym and at the local swimming pool. She feels lucky because her family treated her in just the same way as her other siblings.
When Katy was a child, she didn’t like to put her prosthetic legs on because she was much faster without them. Other children would ask “What happened to you?” Katy’s favorite thing to say was, “Shark attack”! She enjoyed making up stories because she thought it was boring to say “I’ve been like this all my life.” 

A brave career choice 
When a person is born without legs, there are plenty of things that are difficult or even impossible to do. But Katy believed she could achieve anything. 
So she chose two occupations that are difficult, even with both legs. When she was a teenager she saw a production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. One of the actors was Katy’s classmate at school. Before the play was over, Katy had made her mind up to be an actor. 

A new pair of legs and new challenges 
She did got a degree in theater and then moved to Los Angeles where she has played roles in theater, television and movies. She has a positive outlook on life. She thinks that if you believe you can do something, you should go for it, and you shouldn’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do it. So when Katy’s prosthetist asked her if she’d like to try running, she said ‘yes’. She was twenty-five and she had never run before, but as an actor, she liked to stay in shape. She thought running would be a good way to do that. She was given a pair of running legs, and she set outstarted out on a new chapter of her life.

Tragedy, then triumph on the track 
Katy was the first person in the world with two prosthetic legs to take up running as a competitive sport. In 2007 she was chosen for the US Paralympic team but during training she fell over and missed the chance to compete in the 2008 Beijing Paralympic games.  She was devastated, and gave up running for two years. But then she took it up again and qualified for the final of the 100 meters in the 2012 London Paralympics. 
She didn’t win, but she did beat her personal best time and set a new American record. She said that it was one of the most amazing moments of her life.
Katy’s family, friends and fans look up to her as an example of someone who has overcome her disability and fulfilled her ambitions.

Visualization 
Before an important event, I advise athletes to visit the stadium. This allows them to visualize the day of the competition. They can imagine the smells and the sounds in the stadium, and they imagine winning the competition. Then, when the day of the competition arrives, they try to recreate the success they imagined.

Positive thinking
I encourage athletes to talk to themselves before a big race. I force them to concentrate on the times when they won. They need to stay in the present and tell the negative voice in their head to stop talking. Good athletes want to win, but top athletes expect to win. That’s positive thinking! 





Relaxation
Even top athletes can’t help feeling nervous, especially when they find themselves standing next to last year’s champion! I let them talk to me about their worries, but on the day of the competition, negative thoughts are not allowed! It’s a simple fact that if they manage to control their nerves, they tend to do better. Winning – it’s all in the mind!

Hi everyone! My name’s Liliana and I’m a swimmer. And I’m talking to you today because I want to encourage you to take up swimming. It’s a great sport, it isn’t expensive to do and it keeps you really healthy. I started swimming when I was very young. I think I learnedt to swim when I was about five. I didn’t learn at the local public pool, but when I was in Spain on vacation with my parents! Then, when we came home, my parents paid for lessons classes for me and I went once a week. I loved it right away and I got better and better. When I started high school I joined a swimming club and then I started going swimming two times a week. I had a great coach called Vesla who came from Norway, I think. She was really good. We trained very hard – sometimes we were swimming non-stop for two hours! She encouraged me to enter competitions and I did pretty well. Nearly every Saturday a group of us from the swimming club went by charter bus to other towns to have competitions. That was a lot of fun. 
After I’d won quite a few competitions I moved into the advanced class at the club and I had a coach who was once an Olympic winner! He wanted me to go training every day before school for an hour and a half. 
My parents didn’t agree because I needed to be awake for my school work. But they let me go two mornings a week. During school breaks, I can go every day. 

I love swimming and I would really recommend it as a sport to everyone. It isn’t important to enter lots of competitions like I did, but just do it for fun and to stay in shape!

Interviewer:	What do you think about the news that there’s a lion in the resort?
Woman 1:	I’m terrified! I heard it. I was just making the tea when I heard a loud roar – it must be a lion. I’ve never heard anything like that before. It’s very frightening, but I’m pleased the police are looking for it. I hope they find it before it finds them!
Interviewer:	And you sir?
Man 1:	I don’t really know what to think. Several people say they saw a lion, so I suppose it might have escaped from the zoo. There’s a zoo about twenty miles from here. 
Interviewer:	How about you madam?
Woman 2:	Well, it’s a bit worrying, isn’t it? I have young children, and a dog. It’s the dog I worry about – if the lion has escaped from a zoo, it could be very hungry by now. 
It might not have eaten for a while, and my dog would make a nice snack for a lion! I’m keeping the dog and the kids inside the RV.
Interviewer:	And you madam?
Woman 3:	It’s exciting, isn’t it? I think it could have been somebody’s pet. There are some strange people around here. I know that some people have snakes and crocodiles as pets - why not lions? They’re cute when they’re young. It may have grown too big, and they let it go. 
Interviewer:	Sir? What about you?
Man 2:	I don’t believe it. It can’t be a lion, that’s ridiculous. I think it’s probably a cow.
Interviewer:	And the roar?
Man 2:	Cows make loud noises.

Female speaker: 	Thank you. This is Radio Essex. The search for an escaped lion has now been called off. Police were called to a popular seaside resort  two days ago after receiving calls from worried residents. Several people reported seeing or hearing a lion. The local zoo has confirmed that no lion has escaped. The police found no footprints or any other signs that a large wild animal was in the area, and so they have concluded that it must have been a large domesticated cat.

B:	Oh, it was OK. Pretty good really. We all got along well most of the time. We didn’t have any arguments. Well, not until the last day, and then I had a really big argument with my sister. It was stupid really. I wanted to get off the ship and visit Nassau,  but my sister was tired and wanted to stay on the ship by the pool. She always does what she wants, and she doesn’t think of other people. I had to go to Nassau on my own with our parents. It was really boring.

But it’s impossible to be disappointed with Megève – there are so many different things to do here. There are more than 90 restaurants and cafés. Fortunately, the rain has turned to snow.

BEST STORIES FROM LAST YEAR’S COMPETITION
 
Narrator: 	A 
Speaker 2: 	Under a canoe
I was in the Lake District with my family for our summer vacation. There were four of us: Dad, Mom, my grumpy 12-year-old sister, and me. On the first day, it was raining but we decided to rent some canoes. Mom and I set offstarted out in our canoe while Dad had to share with my sister and put up with her bad mood. The lake was calm, it stopped raining and I felt the warmth of the sun on my shoulders.  All around us were dense forest and steep hills.  On the other side, a waterfall cascaded down the hillside into the lake. “This is all right” I thought.
Seconds later, I was less happy.  While he was admiring the view, Dad crashed into our canoe and knocked us into the water. It was cold – extremely cold.  And wet.
Fortunately, we survived (the cold and the embarrassment).  My sister thought it was so amusing, she cheered up!  Then she wore a smile for the rest of the vacation.  
Narrator: 	B
Speaker 3: 	A perfect sunset
My girlfriend Betty and I were in Barcelona for a weekend.  We had no plans, and spoke no Spanish. We looked through a (Spanish) guidebook in our youth hostel.  We eventually decided to go to the top of Tibidabo, a mountain overlooking Barcelona. If we were lucky, we could watch the sunset over the city.  We set offstarted out by bus from the main square. The bus took us higher and higher above the city. I couldn’t wait to gaze at the stunning views over Barcelona. At every stop, passengers got off until we were the only two left. Then the bus driver stopped the bus and got off too. ‘Tibidabo?’ we asked him.  He pointed to a mountain on the other side of the valley. We were on the wrong mountain!
We sat on a bench overlooking the sparkling lights of the city far below. We had no idea where we were, but we didn’t care because we got our perfect view of a blood-red sunset over Barcelona.   

 
Narrator: 	C
Speaker 4: 	Out in the wild
I love wild animals, so my parents took me on vacation to South Africa for my eighteenth birthday. I remember the vacation as a series of images: the cold blue ocean, funny penguins, miles of unspoiledt beaches, lively cafés and friendly people. But the highlight of the vacation was a three-day safari. Safari parks in South Africa are covered in trees and bushes.  This makes it difficult to spot animals.  But our safari-rangers were really good at finding them: we saw elephants, giraffes, zebras, buffalo bathing in a lake and a family of lions sleeping peacefully under a tree.
Suddenly, we heard a noise close to the jeep. There was a flash of yellow and a loud roar – nobody moved a muscle. The leopard ran back into the bush and left us feeling terrified. Not far away sat two small leopard cubs.
At that moment, I learnedt something: humans created the Internet and spaceships, but we are helpless in the face of nature.

[an elderly man, in his late 60s-70s; West coast American accent]
When my parents got their first car, we were really excited. There weren’t so many cars on the road then, and nobody used to worry about pollution or the environment. There was plenty of clean air. We didn’t use to have seat belts then either. I remember my baby sister would sit in the front with my mother. My father smoked a pipe while he was driving and the car used to be full of smoke!
We used to go on vacation up to Canada every summer by car.  It was a bit boring because we didn’t have computers or DVDs - we’d listen to the radio and look out of the window. In Canada, my father followed a map. We didn’t have GPS then. We’d stop to look at the map, but we couldn’t ask for directions because we didn’t speak French, and nobody used to speak English in those days.

Air travel didn’t use to be very common when I was a young man. It was very expensive, so travelling by air was a luxury. I used to work for an American company and I would travel from London to New York regularly. Then, the flight was just four hours by the Concorde. It takes 8 hours now! On the Concorde the cabin crew would take care of you really well. They’d offer you food, drinks or even cigarettes. Lots of people would smoke… It’s funny – people would dress up to go on a plane. They’d put their best clothes on - men would wear suits and women would wear their smartest outfits. It used to be a glamorous way to travel. Not like now! It’s so stressful. We didn’t use to go through security at the airport. I would carry my Swiss Army knife everywhere. That’s impossible now. Are planes safer now? Probably, but travelling by air is a very different experience.

Left or right?
Today, 75% of cars are driven on the right side of the road, but it didn’t always use to be like that.  In fact, everybody used to travel on the left! In Roman times, roads used to be dangerous and travellers would carry swords in their right hands. Travellers on horses used to ride on the left side of the road so that the right hand was free to use the sword.  Then Napoleon changed the rule. Why? Because he was a revolutionary! Before the French Revolution, the aristocracy used to travel on the left and poor people would stay on the right.  After the Revolution, the aristocracy joined the poor people on the right and driving on the right became the new law. What about the rest of the world? China, Portugal, Sweden and parts of Canada used to drive on the left and only changed the law during the mid-twentieth century.  More than fifty countries including the UK, Australia, Japan and India still drive on the left today.

Sofia:	Oh rightOK. Don’t worry! I had the same problem last year when I went to Paris. How long will you be there?
Mark:	I’m going for a month.
Sofia:	OK, the first thing you should do is check the weather forecast. I know it’s summer, but it can get cold in the evenings. If I were you, I’d pack lots of T-shirts and a couple of sweatshirts. How big is your suitcase?
Mark:	It’s not very big. I don’t want to check it in.
Sofia:	Hm, I think you should check it in – if you don’t, you can’t take shampoo and shower gel. 
Mark:	Oh, I didn’t think of that. Right, I’ll take my mom and dad’s suitcase. How many pairs of jeans do I need?
Sofia:	You probably don’t need to take more than two pairs of jeans. But you really ought to take some dressy pants for going out. Now, what about a present for the family? You mustn’t forget to take them something.
Mark:	Oh yeah, of course. What do you think I should take?
Sofia:	The best thing would be to get something at the airport like a box of chocolates.
Mark: 	Good thinking!
Sofia:	Oh, just one more thing. It’s a good idea to write a list of things you might forget, like your phone, tickets, money etc. 
Mark:	Thanks, Sofia. That’s really helpful. 
Sofia:	Ha ha. You’re welcome. And don’t forget your phone charger – I want to see lots of photos of France.

[man in his 60s]
Speaker:	It's so easy to plan a trip these days, isn't it? That's because of the Internet, of course. When I used to travel as a young man, I would find a travel agent to book a hotel room overseas. I would ask the agent a lot questions and he would give me some ideas for the trip. He had brochures and things like that, but the pictures in them were always glossy and professional, taken from the best angles. I had no real idea what the hotel would be like; there was nowhere to read comments by other tourists. Now, I know exactly where I'm going and what to expect.

[Radio interview; interviewer – male, in his 40s; nutritionist – female, in her 30s; standard American English]
Interviewer:	Good morning and welcome to the Food Program. Today our guest is nutritionist Sandra Duffy. Hello and welcome to the program Sandra.
Nutritionist:	Hello. Thanks for inviting me.
Interviewer:	Sandra, how do I know if my diet is healthy or not?
Nutritionist:	Well, that’s a good question, and the easy answer is: do you feel well? Do you have plenty of energy? And secondly, do you look well? Do your skin and your hair look healthy? If you don’t feel or look well, your diet may not be healthy. I always say that a healthy diet is a balanced one.  You need a bit of everything, but not too much of anything. Especially salt or sugar – a little salt and sugar is OK but you shouldn’t eat too much. For instance, there is a lot of salt in potato chipsfries and fast food, and a huge amount of sugar in fizzy sodadrinks. I don’t think people realize this. 
	
If you have a balanced diet, you get enough protein and vitamins. One of the healthiest diets in the world is the Mediterranean diet, and that’s because Mediterranean people eat a huge variety of fresh food. Their diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, cereals, pasta, olive oil and fish. Just think about all the different Mediterranean vegetables: green peppers, red tomatoes, lettuce, purple eggplants, yellow corn, black olives. A healthy meal is a colorful one. Even if you can’t find Mediterranean vegetables, try to make your meals as colorful and varied as you can. Finally, one of the most important things about a healthy diet is that it must not be an obsession. Thinking about food is good - but if you become a very fussy eater, then your diet is probably not healthy.

Speaker:	I’m interested in having a natural diet, and so for the last two years, I’ve only eaten raw food.  I believe that when you cook fresh food, you lose the goodness and vitamins in the food.  I eat raw vegetables, but of course I need protein. So I eat raw eggs. For dessert I eat fruit. I feel healthy and I have lots of energy, but it’s difficult to eat with the rest of my family, and that’s a problem.

Speaker:	I love desserts – cakes, puddings, chocolate – anything sweet. But one day I read an article about sugar, and how bad it is for you. I thought about giving up desserts but I couldn’t do it – it’s impossible! So I decided to divide the week into dessert days and non-dessert days. Now there are five days of the week when I don’t eat desserts but over the weekend I can eat as many desserts as I like. On non-dessert days I eat more fresh fruit, which is much healthier.

Narrator: 	Three
[female speaker; standard British accent]
Speaker:	I only eat food that is grown or produced near my home. That means there's less choice because I don't live in a tropical country! But the fruit and vegetables I eat are really fresh and they taste so good. I do eat a lot of vegetables but I'm not vegetarian. I tried once when I was about 14, but I missed meat, especially roasted chicken. Now, my parents have hens in the backyard so we have fresh eggs every day. The best thing about eating locally produced food is that it's good for the environment – no planes or trucks are involved in transporting food for long distances. I think that's a good thing.

Speaker:	I’m a vegan. That means that I don’t eat or use any animal products for any purpose.  I don’t eat meat, fish, dairy or anything that comes from animals. I don’t wear clothes made from animals either.  When I was a child I ate meat and drank milk like most people. But then when I was 13 I started thinking about where my food came from.  I learnt learned about how animals suffer and I was shocked. I decided to become a vegan and I’ve become very good at cooking awesome vegan meals.  I respect animals and I don’t want them to suffer.

 [narrator male – early 20s, standard American English]
Tristram Stuart is the author of Waste – uncovering the global food scandal. In the article below, he describes an event he organized in London. He wanted to bring people’s attention to the problem of food waste and show how we can help to feed the world and protect the environment. 
Imagine seeing this offer next time you’re in a supermarket: ‘For every carrot you eat, another one will be wasted.’ Sadly, this is not far from the truth.
 In a world where there are more than a billion hungry people, it’s a scandal that all this food is wasted. We are forcing global food prices to go up because we buy more than we need and throw it away. In Africa and Asia, people cannot afford the high food prices and they go without food. 
We organized our ‘Feeding the 5,000’ event in London to highlight this problem. We invited charities, government organisations, chefs, farmers and the general public. 
At the event, we served more than 5,000 portions of fresh hot vegetable curry. For drinks we pressed a few thousand fresh apples to make juice. More than 300 volunteers helped to chop up vegetables and cook the curry. 
‘Friends of the Earth’ brought along four pigs to eat up the leftover apple pulp from the apple pressing. We wanted to show that feeding pigs with our food waste is better than feeding them with soy-based feed. We import millions of tonnes of soy which is grown on land where rainforests used to be. 
All the ingredients for the curry and apple juice were donated by UK farmers. The fruit and vegetables were not perfect enough for stores. 
We also gave tips about other ways to use up our leftover food. People don’t realize how many meals we can get from one chicken. Most of us sit down to a roasted chicken on Sundays and the rest can be used to make a delicious risotto or a great filling for a sandwich. The crusts of these sandwiches can be cut up, fried in a little olive oil, then chopped up and put in salads and soups. 
Did you know that more potatoes are wasted than any other vegetable? They shouldn’t be thrown away. They can be mashed or fried for another meal, or even put in the freezer. In addition to this, black bananas, which people quickly throw away, can be fried in brown sugar and eaten with cream for a tasty dessert. 
‘Feeding the 5,000’ was a wonderful event. People united under the same message: throwing away perfectly good, edible food is crazy.’ 

Why are we throwing away so much and who is responsible? Supermarkets are blamed for rejecting ‘ugly’ fruit and vegetables; consumers are blamed for overbuying or refusing to buy ‘funny looking’ vegetables; chefs are blamed for serving large portions and so on. 
The truth is that food is wasted in supermarkets, homes, restaurants and on farms. We are all responsible for solving the problem. So it’s time to ask ourselves a simple question: how can we continue to waste food in a world where people are hungry and natural resources are disappearing? 
The solution to food waste is simple: buy good food, enjoy it and eat everything on your plate instead of throwing it away!

Speaker 1:	My mom makes a fantastic bread and butter pudding. She gave me the recipe and it’s very easy. You slice the stale bread and put butter on it. Put the slices of bread and butter in a dish. You can add some dried fruit too if you like. It’s up to you. Oh, and if you have some bananas that are too ripe, chop them up and put them in the pudding. Then heat some milk in a small pan. Don’t boil it.  Mix three eggs with three large spoons of sugar and add the warm milk. Then you pour the mixture over the bread. Put it in the oven for 45 minutes, and that’s it! Delicious!

Presenter:	Hello and welcome to “The Future is Green”. Today we’re talking about a special project to make schools more environmentally friendly. We have a 12th grade student named Michael James to tell us about it. Hi Michael, and thanks for talking to us today.
Michael:	That’s OK. I’m missing a few classes, so I don’t mind at all.
Presenter:	Ha ha ha. Now, can you tell us about your project? How did it begin?
Michael:	About a year and a half ago, one of our teachers started an after-school club called “Friends of the Planet”. At first, it was just for students from our school, but then we contacted other schools in our area. Now our ‘Friends of the Planet’ group has members from six other Secondary high schools. We meet once a week and for the last six months, we’ve been working on this special project. 
Presenter:	I see. What exactly is this special project?
Michael:	Basically, we’ve designed an Eco School of the future. We worked with a group of architects who are planning to build a school that is more environmentally friendly. 
The architects contacted our group because they wanted to involve young people and together, we’ve made a model of how this Eco School will look. 
Presenter:	It sounds very exciting. Michael has brought the model of the Eco School into the studio with him. Can you explain it to our listeners, please Michael?
Michael:	Sure. First of all we have solar panels on the roof of the school - there are fifty panels altogether.
Presenter:	And will they provide power for the whole school?
Michael:	Yes, that’s the idea. It will save a lot of money on electricity. 
Presenter:	Ah yes, I can imagine. Tell me about the garden.
Michael:	Our Eco School will grow vegetables, and we’ll use them for school lunches. So our school lunches will be very organic and much cheaper than buying food from the local supermarket or even from a local farm. We’ll also have chickens, rabbits and ducks.
Presenter:	And will they go into the school lunches too?
Michael:	Ha ha, no. That would be terrible. They’ll be pets and they’ll be useful. They’ll eat the leftovers from the kitchen and the chickens will provide eggs.
Presenter:	Very good. So what other plans do you have to make the school more environmentally friendly?
Michael:	We’ll use low-energy light bulbs in all the classrooms. We’ll also have recycling bins in every classroom and on the school grounds. 
Presenter:	And what about your classes - will they be different from non Eco Schools?
Michael:	Most of our classes will be similar to classes in any high school. But in our science classes we’ll focus more on environmental issues like climate change and global warming. Then, in our technology classes we’ll learn about things like renewable energy and even how to make solar panels. 
Presenter:	I see. Well, we’ve almost run out of time. Thank you for talking to us about your project. It’s very nice to meet a teenager who is so concerned about the environment. In my experience, most 17 and 18 year olds are only interested in gadgets and games. 
Michael:	Well, I like gadgets and games too, but I probably worry about the environment more than my friends. 
Presenter:	We must stop there - thank you Michael. Your project sounds fascinating, and I’ll look forward to visiting your Eco School when ... [fade out]

Google Earth and the Amazonian tribe
When Google Earth was set up in 2005, satellite technology changed forever the way we see the world and we all became global tourists. Now, anybody can ‘visit’ anywhere on earth – places you never imagined visiting such as Antarctica and the Sahara Desert. All you need for your virtual world trip is a computer and an Internet connection. Teachers use Google Earth to bring history and geography lessons classes alive: you can learn how the Romans lived by exploring Pompeii in southern Italy, experience a dense rainforest or even travel through the valleys of the Grand Canyon.

But Google Earth is not just a fun way to explore the world. It can also inform people about environmental issues such as deforestation, endangered species and climate change. When Google Earth first appeared, nobody could have imagined that an Amazonian tribe would use this tool to help them protect their environment and their culture.



The Surui tribe live in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. They had not had any contact with the outside world until 1969. Then illegal loggers started to invade their land and destroy the forest. Without the forest, the Surui community would not survive and they knew they had to take action. So they elected Chief Almir as one of the leaders of the tribe. He looked for ways to bring the story of his people to the global community and raise awareness of their problems.

Chief Almir first came across Google Earth on a visit to an Internet café. He immediately realised that he could use the interactive maps to tell people about the illegal logging that was destroying his people’s environment. 

The tribal chief wanted to show the effects of deforestation, not only on his local community, but on a global scale too. He understood that deforestation was destroying plants and wildlife and causing global warming. He contacted Google and then travelled from the Amazon rainforest to Google headquarters in California and told them his story. They discussed ways of working together. As the Chief said, “The Surui know little about the Internet, but Google knows little about the forest, so working together we will be stronger.”



Google sent trainers to teach Surui teenagers how to use mobile cell phones to create YouTube videos and then upload them to Google Earth to share their way of life with people around the world. For five years the Surui tribe and Google worked as a team. They combined modern technology with the tribe’s traditional knowledge of the rainforest. Rebecca Moore, Google employee, said that the Surui people and Google had worked together to bring the story of the forest to the global community. She thought Google would help other people all over the world.

An American boy, who is now 21 years old, owes his life to a gorilla at Brookfield Zoo. When he was three years old his family took him to the zoo. He wanted a better view of the gorillas so he climbed a wall and fell 20 feet into the gorilla enclosure, where a female gorilla was feeding her baby. The gorilla, which was called Binti Jua, went over to the boy, who was unconscious. Then, the gorilla, whose baby was still in her arms, lifted the boy up gently and carried him to the door. The boy spent four days in the hospital, where he made a complete recovery. Binti Jua is still at Brookfield Zoo near Chicago.

THE SURFER, THE SHARK AND THE DOLPHINS
It was a perfect day for surfing off the coast of California. Todd Endris, who lived next to the beach, was out on his surfboard. Without warning, something hit him from under the water. Todd knew immediately that it was a shark. He got back on his board but the shark, which was sixteen feet long, bit him on the back. Todd’s friend, who was surfing close by, saw the huge shark and at first thought it was a whale. Todd, whose right leg was now in the shark’s mouth, was kicking the shark with his free leg, and didn’t see the dolphins, which had been playing in the waves nearby. Suddenly, the shark let go of his leg. The dolphins had surrounded the injured surfer and were protecting him from the shark. Three friends helped Todd get back on his board and reach the beach. A helicopter transported him to a hospital, where surgeons managed to save his leg. Six weeks later Todd was back in the water.

Boy pupil:	Personally, I think they’re all great. The three logos focus on the environment. Logos 2 and 3 are attractive and amusing. But I think the best option would be logo number 1 because it has a serious message about learning.
Girl pupil:	I agree, but the problem with logo number 1 is that it doesn’t mention ‘Eco School’. Logo number 2 looks attractive, but it doesn’t illustrate school or learning. So I’d choose number 3 because it’s clever and simple.
Boy pupil:	Personally, I wouldn’t go for number 3. I’d definitely choose logo number 1 because it’s more effective than the other two, and the message is clear. The words suggest that we are responsible for the future of the planet. 
Head Teacher:	Out of these three logos, I’d choose logo number 3. I wouldn’t choose the logo showing vegetables because it doesn’t look serious. I like logo number 3 for two reasons. 
Firstly because the glasses suggest learning and secondly, because I think we need the words ‘Eco School’ in the logo. So let’s go for number 3. I’ll call the designer …

[two adult speakers, male and female; man is a radio presenter; woman is a scientist; West coast American accents]
Man: 	Today our guest is Doctor Jenna Clarke. Doctor Clarke, who is a biologist, has studied the monarch butterfly. She is going to tell us about its life and why it is in danger of disappearing. Welcome, Doctor Clarke.
Woman: 	Thank you, it's good to be here. Let me begin by giving the listeners some basic information about the monarch butterfly. It is recognized by its unique orange and black pattern. And though it is found in Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia, the largest population is in the United States. The monarch is famous for its long migration in the late summer from the United States to Mexico, where it goes to spend the winter. Millions of butterflies go to forests there, where they are protected from rain and freezing cold temperatures. Otherwise they will die. 
Man: 	But there's a problem.

Woman: 	Yes, there is. The monarch is in danger. A recent report said the number of butterflies that arrived in Mexico this year was 60 percent less than last year. In fact, numbers have been falling for the last seven years. If numbers continue to fall, the monarch butterfly will completely disappear from North America.
Man:	So if fewer butterflies are reaching Mexico, does that mean the problem is in the United States?
Woman: 	Partly, yes. You see, the monarch butterfly depends on a plant called milkweed to survive. It's the only food young monarch butterflies eat. In the United States, the chemicals that farmers use on crops are destroying the milkweed plant. So if we want to save the monarch butterfly, we have to protect the milkweed plant. 
Man: 	What else is making it difficult for the monarch butterfly to survive?
Woman: 	The monarch goes to a specific forest area in Mexico. Unfortunately, logging in that area is reducing the number of trees. The trees, which are cut down illegally and sold, are the homes of the monarch
Man: 	So, many are dying in the U.S. because they don't have enough food and then the ones that manage to arrive in Mexico have a smaller area to live in.
Woman: 	That's right. Finding a solution is hard because it involves two different countries and two different problems. If we can persuade farmers in the U.S. not to use certain chemicals, that will be a big step forward. But if the logging in Mexico isn't stopped, the number of monarchs will continue to drop. Both problems are serious and must be solved at the same time.
Man: 	Is there any good news for the monarch?
Woman: 	Actually, there is. The monarch is becoming more common in Bermuda because people are planting milkweed in their gardens. And monarch butterflies born in Bermuda stay there all year due to the warm weather. Perhaps Maybe these island monarchs will save the species.

Girl:	Woah, that’s crazy.
Boy:	What are you reading?
Girl :	I’m reading about famous people and which parts of their body they’ve insured for loads of money. It says here that Ronaldo’s legs are insured for 144 million dollars! Those are expensive legs. 
Boy:	144 million! Well, soccer’s a dangerous game, isn’t it. You don’t just get cuts and bruises. You could break your leg or sprain your ankle.
Girl :	I know. I can understand why Ronaldo has decided to insure his legs, but why do you think Rihanna has insured her legs? 
Boy:	Rihanna the singer? 
Girl:	[sarcastically] No, Rihanna the football player! Of course I mean Rihanna the singer. Why hasn’t she insured her voice? 
Boy:	Hmm. Good question. She probably thinks her looks are more important than her voice.
Girl: 	Yes, I suppose so. Who’s Keith Richards? Is he the old guy in Pirates of the Caribbean?
Boy:	Keith Richards? Yeah, and he’s a guitarist in a band - the Rolling Stones. 
Girl :	Well, his hands are insured for 1 million dollars. They look terrible. What could happen to your hands?
Boy:	Lots of things. You could burn your fingers with a cigarette, for instance, or dislocate your thumb. 
Girl:	Ah right. Hey did you know that James Bond does all his own stunts?
Boy:	You mean Daniel Craig? Yes, I think I read that somewhere. What has he insured? His face?
Girl :	No, his body. He’s insured it after he broke a rib and cut his hand. [pause] Oh, this is funny.
Boy:	What?
Girl: 	There’s an American football player who’s insured his hair for a million dollars. His hair?! Oh, he’s got an advertising contract with a shampoo company. His name’s Troy Polamalu. 
Boy:	Never heard of him. Is that it?
Girl:	There’s one more. What do you think Julia Roberts has insured?
Boy:	Her teeth and her lips?
Girl :	Ha ha ha - yes, you’re right.

[This a podcast. Part of an online first aid course. The man is in his twenties and the woman is in her thirties; man standard British accent, woman standard American English] 
Man:	Welcome to our online first aid course. First of all, we’d like to check that you got the right answers to the quiz. We gave you 6 minor accidents and asked what you would do. Here’s Dr. Maxwell to tell you what she would do. 
Woman:	Thank you. OK, number one. If I had a nosebleed, I’d hold my nose and look down. If I looked up, the blood would go down my throat, and that would be horrible. Number two, if I burnedt my hand, I’d hold it under the cold water faucet. Cold water would take the pain away. Don’t put oil or butter on the burn – this will make it worse.   Number three, if I twisted my ankle, I’d put ice on it very quickly – ice is fantastic for ankles and other muscle injuries. You shouldn’t put heat on a twisted ankle - that would make it worse. 
Number four, if I got a black eye, I’d put ice on it for the same reasons as number three. Eye drops could make it worse. 

Number five, if a bee stung me, I’d take some antihistamine tabletspills. I’m allergic to bee stings, so I always have antihistamine tablets pills  with me.  I’d put ice on the sting if I didn’t have any tabletspills. It’s probably not a good idea to put a band aid  age on because the stinger might still be in the skin. Finally, number six, if I cut my finger I’d wash it, dry it and put a bandage on. It’s not a good idea to stop the blood flow to the hand, so don’t tie something around your wrist.
Man:	Thank you, Dr. Maxwell. If you got those right, you’re ready to move on to the next part of this online first aid course.

Rob:	Well, I’m taking part in the Bike to the Beach ride and I want to raise some money for charity. Do you know how I can do that?
Anna:	Sure – I did the Boston Marathon last year. You have to ask your friends to sponsor you. In other words, they support you by giving you money. You have to set up a webpage first.
Rob:	OK, what sort of information do I put on the webpage?
Anna:	You explain what event you’re doing – so you’re going to do the Bike to the Beach Ride. Then you put some information about the charity you want to support. Which charity are you interested in?
Rob:	I want to do it for CAN, the Cure Autism Now Foundation.
Anna:	OK, great – do you have any particular reason?
Rob:	Yes, it was my aunt’s idea - my uncle is autistic.
Anna:	OK, so you can say on the webpage that you’re doing it in memory support of your uncle. Then you share the page with all your friends and family. It’s a good idea to send it to all the adults you know because people our age don’t have any money!

 [Narrator female, 30ish/40ish, standard American English] 
I’m sure everyone here knows all about the terrible sickillness, Ebola, which is affecting thousands and thousands of people in Africa. There have been a few cases in Europe and America but the problem is still mainly in African countries. At the moment scientists are working very hard to find a vaccine because normal medicines don’t work. People don’t catch the sickillness from the air but from touching other people who have it. This makes it hard for doctors and nurses who are caring for the sick. We really need to help them. They need more money for research, hospitals and more doctors. So, that’s why I’m talking to you today. The school is planning to have a walk for charity next weekend. Last year we organized a marathon swim and we raised over $4,500 for the local children’s hospital. This time we hope to get more, perhaps maybe over $7,500! The event will start at the school on Saturday morning at 10:30. The route will go through the forest and across the hills to Brockfield. The fastest walkers should take about three hours. The slowest, like me will take quite a lot longer! But we hope the last people will arrive in Brockfield before 4:30. So get your walking shoes on and join us on Saturday to help fight Ebola!

Speaker 1:	A STORY OF HOPE
Hope is a 16-year-old girl who got malaria and recovered. Her classmate tells her story here: 
Speaker 2:	Hope was one of the best students in our class. But she had been absent from school for several weeks and we were worried. We decided to go to her village and find out what was wrong. 
When we arrived, Hope’s mother told us that Hope was sick with malaria. We were shocked - we knew how serious malaria could be. We asked how it had started. Hope’s mother explained, ‘One evening, Hope was really hot, and had terrible headaches. She had no appetite. This went on for a few days. We thought that she had been in the sun too long. My husband gave Hope some herbal medicine, but it didn’t help. 
Her condition began to get worse and she developed new symptoms. The fever got higher and she started vomiting. At this point, I was sure she had malaria, but I didn’t know what to do.’
Fortunately, we had learned about malaria at school, and Hope told her mother that she needed medicine quickly. Her mother took Hope to the hospital. She didn’t want to lose another child. 
Two years before, Hope’s baby brother had fallen ill sick with malaria and died.
At the hospital, the doctor had examined Hope and diagnosed malaria. He had given her an injection and prescribed some medicine. And now she was getting better thanks to the treatment. 
We asked if we could see her. We weren’t worried about catching the disease – we knew that malaria was not contagious. At school we had learnt learned that you catch malaria at night, from female mosquitoes. So we were upset to see that Hope was sleeping without a mosquito net.
We told our friend about a place where her parents could get free mosquito nets. We told her we wanted her to come back to school soon. We know that she was very lucky to recover from this disease that kills one baby every 60 seconds.

Decision time
In 1985, two young climbers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, were the first climbers to climb the west face of the Siula Grande Mountain in the Andes. But as they were coming down the mountain, Simpson fell and broke his leg badly. Yates had to make a terrible decision: should he leave his friend or should he try to get him down the mountain. He chose the second option. If he had left his friend, Simpson would have died. Yates tied himself to Simpson with a rope and they slowly came down the mountain together. Then disaster struck again. Simpson fell and was hanging over a cliff. Yates couldn’t hold him. He found his pocketenknife and decided to cut the rope. Simpson fell 80 feet.  Yates returned to base camp alone. He was sure Simpson was dead. But he also knew that if he hadn’t cut the rope, he would have fallen and died too. Miraculously, Simpson didn’t die. He pulled himself slowly along the ground with a broken leg for three days and nights. He arrived back at base camp just in time. Yates would have already left if Simpson had arrived a few hours later.

Presenter:	Good evening and welcome to the media show. Last week we discussed nature documentaries and today, we are looking at another popular kind of program – reality television. In the studio with us is Ruth Wilson, media expert and head of Wilson Television Studios. Hello, Ruth.
Ruth Wilson:	Hello.
Presenter:	Ruth, you’re very intelligent – you don’t watch reality TV, do you?
Ruth Wilson:	[laughs] Well, no, not all the time. Of course not. But I am interested in people, so I find some reality shows absolutely fascinating.
Presenter:	OK, but do you think we should allow children to watch reality TV? Some of the people on these programs are rather unpleasant.
Ruth Wilson:	Well, yes, you’re right. In fact, some people can be absolutely awful. So I don’t think they’re suitable for young children.
Presenter:	Personally, I’d rather watch a really good detective show. But reality TV shows are very popular. Why is that?
Ruth Wilson:	Well, reality TV is all about story-telling, and everybody loves a good story.
Presenter:	So you think reality shows and a well-written TV series are quite similar? 
Ruth Wilson:	Yes, I do. The success of a television show depends on a good script and a good cast of actors. It’s the same for a reality series and that’s really difficult. It’s absolutely essential to have characters that people are interested in. They may be really likeable or they may be really horrible, but people want to watch the program and see what happens to them.
Presenter:	    So what kind of people make a good reality TV show?
Ruth Wilson:	The best reality TV characters get a reaction from the viewers - they could be very funny or rather silly or absolutely gorgeous. It helps if they are not what they seem to be. For instance, a very ordinary-looking man comes on stage for his X Factor audition and you think it’s going to be a disaster, but then his voice is absolutely amazing.  And don’t forget there are some extremely talented people in these programs.
Presenter:	That’s right. It’s not all bad. Well thank you very much for joining us ... [fade out]

[a podcast of someone explaining what a viral video is; adult female speaker; standard British accent]
A viral video is a video that becomes popular very quickly through the Internet. People share the video through social media and email. There isn’t a formula for a viral video hit. But the most popular ones have three things in common. Firstly, they’re really short. People have short attention spans, especially when they’re looking at websites, so the most successful viral videos are around three minutes long. Secondly, they engage your emotions - they may be funny, sad, shocking, entertaining or even extremely annoying, but they make viewers feel something. The third ingredient is story.

Speaker 1: 	A viral video is a video that becomes popular very quickly through the Internet. People share the video through social media and email. There isn’t a formula for a viral video hit. But the most popular ones have three things in common. Firstly, they’re really short. People have short attention spans, especially when they’re looking at websites, so the most successful viral videos are around three minutes long. Secondly, they engage your emotions - they may be funny, sad, shocking, entertaining or even extremely annoying, but they make viewers feel something. The third ingredient is story. Many of the most popular viral videos tell a simple story and the ones with an inspirational ending are the most memorable.

Speaker 2:	I have to tell you about this video I saw – somebody sent me the link yesterday and I think I’ve watched it thirty times. It’s absolutely amazing! It’s this boy, he must be 13 or 14, playing the piano at a school concert. At first I thought why has she sent me this? Then the boy started singing. Wow, his voice! He sings Paparazzi by Lady Gaga which is one of my favorite songs anyway, but he sings it soooo well. I watched an interview with the boy afterwards and he has a recording contract now, all because of this video that his mom posted on YouTube. He’s soooo inspiring.

Speaker 3: 	My favorite videos are the ones that make you laugh. It’s usually because somebody does something stupid – for instance, there’s a video of a man who dives into a frozen swimming pool. Well, I say he dives, but of course he hits the ice and slides across the swimming pool. How can you be so stupid?  Then there’s another hilarious video of a girl walking along in a shopping mall. She’s texting and she isn’t looking where she’s going. And she trips over and falls into a fountain. I couldn’t believe it! And I love the one where a baby bites his brother’s finger. The little brother puts his finger in his baby brother’s mouth, and surprise surprise, the baby bites it. I love the expression on the baby’s face - he’s really pleased with himself.

Speaker 4: 	Hi. My name is Nigel Brown and I’m in advertising. I watch videos all day, especially videos that get more than 1 million hits on the web. These are the kind of viral videos that our clients want. I love my job, but when I was growing up, I dreamt of being a famous singer. My parents told me that you had to know somebody famous or you had to have famous parents. But that’s all changed now. Anybody can post a video of himself  themselves on the web and any of you could be famous by next Saturday.  [laughter] Of course it isn’t that easy - there are over one hundred hours of video uploaded to the net every minute and only a few have more than one million views. So how do you predict the kind of video that will go viral? I’d like to give you some examples of successful… fade out …

Viral videos
Nobody knows exactly why online videos go viral. It’s really easy to upload videos to the net. People post videos on social networking sites all the time and then share the links with their friends. Videos that get over 1 million hits are quite rare. Usually, viral videos are short, they engage your emotions in some way and tell a simple story.

The rise of the vloggers
A
Charlie McDonnell was the first British online superstar – he got into vlogging in 2007, when he was a shy sixteen-year-old schoolboy, and since then his videos have been viewed more than 250 million times. His viewers recognize him in the street and when he attends vlogging events, thousands of fans come so that they can see ‘the real him’. His vlogs have been so successful that when he was eighteen, instead of going to college, he decided to make a living from his vlogs. He became a full-time vlogger and now earns more than his parents. His vlogs cover all sorts of topics, including ‘How to make tea’ and ‘How to speak English’.






B
McDonnell’s friend and roommate is twenty five-year-old vlogger and talented singer-songwriter Alex Day. He created his YouTube channel Nerimon for fun. He uploads songs and music videos and his single, Forever Yours, reached number four in the UK charts. Without having a recording contract with a major music label, his first two royalty cheques came to more than $156,000. His success is because of his musical talent alone. He did not have the marketing department of a big company behind him, but simply used social networking to publicize his music.

C
Maybe you’ve come across Lex Croucher? She’s a twenty-two-year-old student. The number of subscribers to her channel Tyrannosauruslexxx comes to 76,000. She got into vlogging because she was bored. When she started out, her vlogs were autobiographical. But then they became serious discussions of issues. For example, her university course did not live up to her expectations, so she vlogged about it. It’s hard to imagine how she keeps up with her studies as she not only vlogs, but you can also see her on Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook. But she manages to come up with amusing and interesting vlogs. 
Her success is based on her talent, but also her choice of topics that other teenagers can relate to.

[same narrator as in previous exercise]
Making good videos is not as easy as it looks. Successful vloggers like Charlie, Alex and Lex are bright and creative. They got into vlogging because they genuinely enjoy what they do, and they are just a little bit funnier and cooler than their audience. They have to work hard to live up to the expectations of their fans: most of them post new vlogs several times a week. Vloggers interact with their audience: they ask them questions and they get immediate feedback. The vlogger has to keep up with all this feedback so that he or she knows what viewers like most. If the viewers like the vloggers and their vlogs they are more likely to share their videos – the more shares a vlogger get, the more money they will make from advertising. It’s easy to make a vlog, but the successful ones are successful because they come up with good stuff....very good stuff. Their earnings can come to more than $100,000 a year! If you come across one of their vlogs by chance and then decide to follow them you are helping to make them just a little more money.

Jessica:	That’s right - so what went wrong?
Darina:	They didn’t ask me about my work - they asked me what I was going to wear to the Oscars. They asked me who I was dating and why I’d split up with my fiancé. They asked if I’d put on weight and whether I was on a diet. 
Jessica:	They asked you what?!


Darina:	Yes… And that’s not all. They wanted to take photographs and they asked me to wear something [with distaste in her voice] feminine.  Then they asked me not to look too serious and to blow a kiss at the camera. Blow a kiss!!! Who do they think I am? Marilyn Monroe??

Male 1:	On the show today we'd like to hear your thoughts on the famous Notting Hill Carnival in London.

Narrator: 	One
Female 1:	I love Caribbean culture and the festival is great fun, but you can enjoy it even more if you go well prepared, and believe me, I learnt learned the hard way! Most importantly, you need to wear comfortable shoes. Leave the high heels at home because you can't dance in them, and never … ever … wear sandals. You won't come across a bigger street festival in Europe, it's crowded, and I promise you other dancers will step on your toes. You don't want to spend the rest of the day with sore feet like I did. 

 
Narrator: 	Two
Male 2:	What is absolutely fantastic about the Notting Hill Carnival is it changes the mood in London. There's an amazing party atmosphere and a lot of it is thanks to the parade. It looks like the Rio carnival in Brazil with the floats and the crowds of people dancing in the streets. And although everyone would agree that London is a great city, it isn't exactly famous for its vibrant colors. Well, for one weekend a year, it just explodes with every color under the sun. The make-up and costumes of the performers are the brightest I've ever seen! 

Narrator: 	Three
Teenage speaker aged 17
Female 2:	I love the crowds, the noise and the carnival atmosphere! Everyone's so happy and lively. Every year, our dance teacher makes us work hard and we practice until our feet are sore. When our families come to watch us in the parade, we want to make them proud. Mom always tells me that I'm the best dancer in the group, which probably isn't true, but that's OK, I enjoy it anyway! The Notting Hill carnival was, and still is, a time for people to get together and have fun. I'm really glad someone came up with the idea!
Narrator: 	Four
Male 3:	I'm extremely lucky! I live in Notting Hill, so the carnival is practically on my doorstep. It gets fairly noisy here, but I don't mind all the performers and the Caribbean music at all. Of course, the streets are pretty crowded too with all the visitors … apparently, over a million people attended this year. Some local residents told me that they found the carnival rather annoying because it made it difficult for them to come and go, but really, it's only on for three days. I love every minute and always look forward to it!

Alcatraz is located in San Francisco Bay. It was a prison from 1934 to 1963 and during that time there were just 14 escape attempts. The attempted escape in 1962 will probably be remembered as the most famous one. Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers dug a tunnel out of their cells and then disappeared. The three men may have drowned, but their bodies have never been discovered. Over the years, several postcards in the men’s handwriting have been sent to their families. After the escape, a stolen car was found and police believe it could have been used by the three men to escape. The case will be kept open until the 100th  birthday of the three men. Today, Alcatraz Island is being used as a recreation park.

[two speakers: Daniel – 17 years old; presenter – woman in her 20s; standard American English]
Presenter:	This week our special report asks ‘Are we doing enough to help juvenile offenders to become better citizens?’ Today, 3 out of 4 juvenile offenders who are released from detention centers, go on to commit another crime, and return to detention. The Government say they want to improve education in juvenile offenders’ detention centers. But some people believe that juvenile detention centers are already too soft. They think that you should make an example of teenagers who break the law. They want harder and longer punishments. To talk to us about that we have 17-year-old ex-offender Daniel Smith in the studio with us. Hello Daniel.
Daniel:	Hello.
Presenter:	Daniel you’ve recently been released from a juvenile detention center. What’s it like inside a juvenile detention center?
Daniel:	Noisy. There’s a lot of shouting and fighting. We’re locked in our cells at 8:15 at night and we can watch television until 2 a.m. If we do something wrong, they take our television away. 
Presenter:	I see. So, tell us about the opportunities for education. 
Daniel:	We could choose from about 50 different subjects. Everything from music production to gardening to cooking. I did about 20 hours of classes every week. You are paid for each class you go to, and then you can spend that money on junk food or phone calls. 
Presenter:	You’re paid to go to class?
Daniel:	Yeah. Nobody would go to class if we weren’t paid. It isn’t much - sixty-five cents a class. But I was motivated because this woman came into the prison and offered me a job when I came out. I’m working now and that makes a big difference. 
Presenter:	How many of the other juvenile offenders were as motivated as you to learn new skills?
Daniel:	Not many. A lot of them are happy the way they are and don’t want to change. 
Presenter:	Is it true that some juvenile offenders like being in detention because they have a better life inside than outside?
Daniel:	Yeah. That’s definitely true. One of my friends was homeless before he came to the detention center. 
He was worried about being released - in detention he got food and clean clothes and a warm cell. Outside, he was living in a box on the street. The day he was released, he walked into the detention center parking lot and smashed the windows on five cars. He was back here in a few days. 
Presenter:	Hm, well that brings me to another point. The government want to improve conditions in juvenile detention centers. But some people say that this is wrong. They say that these are young people who have committed crimes and they should be punished. One prison guard said, “They have education, they have a gym and television - it’s like a summer camp!” What do you say to that?
Daniel:	But it’s not summer camp - we can’t see our friends or our family. Doors are locked. I don’t want to go back there. If you want young people to change, you can’t lock them in a cell and expect them to change. You have to educate them and make them believe that there is a better life ahead for them. Simple as that.

[a fragment of ‘The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time’; teenage male voice aged 16; standard American English]
Then the police arrived. I like the police. They have uniforms and numbers and you know what they are meant to be doing. There was a policewoman and a policeman. The policewoman had a little hole in her tights on her left ankle and a red scratch in the middle of the hole. The policeman had a big orange leaf stuck to the bottom of his shoe which was poking out from one side.
The policewoman put her arms around Mrs. Shears and led her back towards the house.
I lifted my head off the grass.
The policeman squatted down beside me and said, ‘Would you like to tell me what’s going on here, young man?’.
I sat up and said ‘The dog is dead.’
‘I’d got that far,’ he said.
I said, ‘I think someone killed the dog.’
 ‘How old are you?’ he asked.
I replied, ‘I am 15 years and 3 months and 2 days.’
‘And what, precisely, were you doing in the garden?’ he asked.
‘I was holding the dog,’ I replied.
‘And why were you holding the dog?’ he asked.
This was a difficult question. It was something I wanted to do. I like dogs. It made me sad to see that the dog was dead.
I like policemen too, and I wanted to answer the question properly.
But the policeman did not give me enough time to work out the correct answer.
‘Why were you holding the dog?’ he asked again.
‘I like dogs,’ I said.
‘Did you kill the dog?’ he asked.
I said, ‘I did not kill the dog.’
‘Is this your fork?’ he asked.
I said, ‘No.’
‘You seem very upset about this,’ he said.
He was asking too many questions and he was asking them too quickly. They were stacking up in my head like loaves in the factory where Uncle Terry works. The factory is a bakery and he operates the slicing machines. And sometimes the slicer is not working fast enough but the bread keeps coming and there is a blockage. I sometimes think of my mind as a machine, but not always as a bread-slicing machine. It makes it easier to explain to other people what is going on inside it.
The policeman said, ‘I am going to ask you once again …’
I rolled back onto the lawn and pressed my forehead to the ground into the grass again and made the noise that Father calls groaning. I make this noise when there is too much information coming into my head from the outside world. It is like when you are upset and you hold the radio against your ear and you tune it halfway between two stations so that all you get is white noise and then you turn the volume right up so that this is all you can hear and then you know you are safe because you cannot hear anything else.
The policeman took hold of my arm and lifted me onto my feet.
I didn’t like him touching me like this.   
And this is when I hit him.

Judy and Mike were living in a single-family house halfway down a nice street.  Their house looked like the other houses, but in fact it was the unluckiest house in the neighborhood.  In a period of five years, they were burglarized 13 times!  After each burglary, they had something done to their house to make it safer and more burglar-proof.

First, they had the locks changed. Then they had a new front door fitted.  That didn’t work, so they had a wall built. Nothing stopped the burglaries.  After the seventh time, they bought a dog and had a big sign put on the gate saying “Beware dangerous dog”. The dog was too friendly, and they were burglarized  again. After the 13th time, they were desperate.  Finally, Mike found out on the Internet that, according to statistics, the highest number of burglaries happen to single-family houses halfway down a street with a purple door and the number 88!  They couldn’t get the house moved to a different location, but they’ve had the door painted green and they’re going to have the house number changed. Mike’s sure that with a green door and the number 86B on it, they’ll never be burglarized again!

Speaker 1:	In my opinion, there are a lot of advantages to doing volunteer work. One benefit is that it makes people think about other people who are less fortunate than they are. What I mean is that if you do volunteer work you will understand the problems that exist in society. Another benefit of doing volunteer work is that you become a better person – less selfish and more generous.

Speaker 2:	First of all, I agree that there are a lot of advantages to doing volunteer work, but I think there are drawbacks too. One of the main disadvantages of volunteer work is that it can take up a lot of time. What I mean is, volunteer work could keep you from helping your own family or friends, or take time away from your studies. Another disadvantage of volunteer work is that you don’t earn money, so you are still dependent on your parents for everything. To be honest, I think we should learn to be independent from our parents as soon as possible.
